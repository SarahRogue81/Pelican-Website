https://www.winboat.app/[WinBoat] is a GNU/Linux app that lets you run various versions of Windoows. i fucked up the first time installing it and had a bitch of a time uninstalling it

but first


i'll describe how i got it running before the install

== initial install, before i fucked it up

WinBoat's GitHub https://github.com/TibixDev/winboat[repo] has the https://github.com/TibixDev/winboat/releases[current release] as and AppImage

after the download, go to the download folder on the command line and execute

[source sh]
----
chmod +x winboat-X.Y.Z.AppImage
----

where X, Y, and Z are the version number. in my case, v0.7.1. **note**: this is beta software and earlier today, it was v0.6.13 but changed rn when i just now checked for this writing

=== before first run

install Docker and Docker Compose

[source sh]
----
sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose

sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker

sudo usermod =a =G docker username
----

to start, i use CachyOS, an ArchLinux distro. the first line will probably be different for. to end, `username` is your user name

finally, be sure the correct Kernel Modules are running

[source sh]
----
echo -e "ip_tables\niptable_nat" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/iptables.conf
sudo reboot
----

=== AppImageLaucher

believe it or not, i'd rather not use the terminal for launching apps and i have an `apps` folder to prove it. so i use AppImageLauncher. to install

[source sh]
----
sudo pacman -S appimagelauncher
----

== then i fucked it all up

when you first run WinBoat, from terminal or otherwise, it displays some sort of BIO or UEFI. i skipped the FreeRDP step of the pre-install, which is required for a Remote Desktop Connection. i saw the text and the logo but it went by so fast that i couldn't read it. by the time i went back to GitHub to read the README, i was convinced that, somehow, me not installing caused that text to display

by that time, the Windodws 11 installer was in the middle of downloading and i clicked WinBoot thinking that the next time i opened it, it would start over

but

it did not start over

it ran the docker image and, of course, nothing happened

=== so, to uninstall the docker image

[source sh]
----
sudo docker volume rm winboat
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker/volumes
----

that last line might be unnecessary but i did it anyway (thx Gemini deep research)

== and so i started over

WinBoat uses QEMU from your default web browser and, below are some pics of the install and what i did after

=== pics

WinBoat lets you install a number of Windows versions, i picked 11 Pro

then the install begins

after some restarts, Windows opens with you already logged in

sorry that i mentioned it before

but

WinBoat, before it creates the Docker image, prompts for RAM, Cores, and Starage Size

i picked 8 GB, 4, and 64 GB respectfully

it also asks for which version of Windows you want and a password to login - this can be anything as it doesn't link to your Microsoft Account

the next thing i did was a Windodws Update

image::03-WinBoat-Windows-Update.webp[]

and also updated the apps in the Microsoft Store

image::04-WinBoat-Microsoft-Store-Updates.webp[]

the apps all got updated first and then Windows Update finished and prompted for a reboot, which i did

i had to log in, with password and was greeted with this minimal desktop and start menu

image::05-WinBoat-Windows-11-Desktop.webp[]

'''

image::06-WinBoat-Windows-11-Start-Menu.webp[]

the next Windows Update simply installed Defender antivirus signatures, which didn't require a reboot

-- caveats

because it is running QEMU in a devault web browser, gaming isn't an option - save maybe the simple Microsoft games, like Mahjong, Minesweeper, Jugsaw, etc

pls using Steam/Proton directly on your GNU/Linux machine for gaming, even simple games

updating WinBoat to the current version involves stopping a WinBoat Windows service and deleting 16 lines at the bottom of the `~/.local/share/applications/appimagekit_*-winboat.desktop` file plus removing the old AppImage in your `~/Applications` folder

no Bluetooth, microphone input, audio output

stopping QEMU from within the WinBoat app does a hard power-off, i believe (but i could be wrong). pausing works just fine

it's constatnly prompting me to stop the WinBoatGuestServer

the Windows 11 Pro install, upgrades and app updates consume 20.5 GB of storage

simply moving the cursor isn't smooth

but

it gets the job done

== last words

this project is off to a great start but i doubt i will use it for anything

i can run Microsoft 365 in my web browser on GNU/Linux and there'a an app for everything else i want to do

i've tested running games on CachyOS and the fps is the same as on my native Windows 11 partition

so i really have no need to Windows

but this project is awesome and fave and *the* tech talk on https://discord.com/[Discord]

hope this information helps
