**Name**: ByteDrainer69

**Age**: Immortal (but my iPhone 17 AIr battery dies in 3 hours)

**Location**: In your notifications

**Looking For**: Someone who can endure my rants about why the sheep follow Apple keynotes. Must hate the new battery icon.

== **Bio**:

- “I promise I don’t bite... unless you’re a tech blogger.”

- I enjoy long scrolls through Twitter, arguing with strangers about innovation.

- My love language is mocking corporate keynote buzzwords.

- [.w3-text-red.w3-bold]##Biggest red flag##: I secretly still read https://9to5mac.com/[9to5Mac].

== **Interests**:

- Screenshotting cringe headlines

- Switching tabs 2 seconds faster than mortals

- Comparing Xiaomi durability to AppleCare+

- Drinking pumpkin spice blood lattes
