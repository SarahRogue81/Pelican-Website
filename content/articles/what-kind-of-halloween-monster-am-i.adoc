== 🧛🏻 The Emo Tech Vampire 🧛🏻

**Alias**: The Eternal Sceptic

**Lair**: Dimly lit rooms, glowing only with the cracked screen of an iPhone 8.

**Alignment**: Anti-hype, pro-decay.

=== Appearance:

    * Pale, sleepless eyes reflecting old Apple keynote streams.

    * Hoodie with frayed cuffs, stained with pumpkin-spice blood.

    * A necklace made of retired Lightning cables.

    * Fingers forever smudged with ghostly screen-glare.

=== Powers:

    * **Hype Drain**: Instantly sucks the life out of tech buzzwords (“Pro Max,” “Titanium,” “AI-powered”) leaving only silence.

    * **Shadow of Obsolescence**: Thrives on outdated devices that refuse to die.

    * **One-Word Curse**: Can slay entire arguments with a single “no.”

    * **Mirror Blackout**: Keynotes and tech blogs glitch whenever you gaze upon them.

=== Weaknesses:

    * Sunlight is fine, but a genuine innovation can burn like holy water.

    * Tempted by nostalgia — old gadgets whisper to you from drawers.

    * Haunted by the ghosts of discontinued features.

=== Aesthetic:

    * Gothic refusal.

    * Eternal night lit by charging cables.

    * Emo poetry scrawled in Keep app drafts.
