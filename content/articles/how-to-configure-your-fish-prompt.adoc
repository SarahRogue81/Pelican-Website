first of all, i love the command shell `fish`!!!

but

i'm a complete noob when it comes to `fish`

however 

i love the way `fish` is setup on https://cachyos.org/[CashyOS] but when i switched to https://www.fedoraproject.org/[Fedora] 42, i missed all of the epic CashyOS features that made `fish` even better 

i felt like i had to do something something like this:

image::python-virtual-environment.webp[]

== the simple solution 

does't work

and that would be transferring my existing `~/.config/fish` folder to Fedora 

even transferring the CashyOS config folder doesn't work 

so what did i do?

copying and pasting, mainly 

== the solution that worked 

is kinda involved but well worth it imho
